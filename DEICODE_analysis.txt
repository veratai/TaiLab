#DEICODE 

#A Novel Sparse Compositional Technique Reveals Microbial Perturbations
#Martino et al. 2019

#DEICODE is a form of Aitchison Distance that is robust to high levels of sparsity. DEICODE utilizes a natural solution to the zero problem formulated in recommendation systems called matrix completion. A simple way to interpret the method is, as a robust compositional PCA (via SVD) where zero values do not influence the resulting ordination. One of the benefits of using DEICODE is the ability to reveal salient inter-community niche feature importance in compositional biplots. These biplot can be easily visualized in the existing QIIME architecture through Emperor.

#run Robust Atchison RPCA (aka robust PCA) Biplot 
# --p-min-feature-count is minimum sum for a feature (ASV) across all samples, otherwise feature is removed
# i.e. features with very low total counts among all samples can be filtered out
# --p-min-sample-count is minimum sum cutoff of reads in a sample across all features
# i.e. sample that received very few reads relative to other samples can be filtered out

#these filtering criteria have likely already been implemented earlier in the data processing, so can use these same parameters
# e.g. qiime feature-table filter-features
#  --p-min-frequency  is the same as --p-min-feature-count

# e.g. qiime feature-table filter-samples
# --p-min-frequency is the same as --p-min-sample-count

to import ordination into R

#make sure qiime2R is updated 
#devtools::install_github("jbisanz/qiime2R")

#don't need to update, we have latest version, 0.99.6, so it is OK
